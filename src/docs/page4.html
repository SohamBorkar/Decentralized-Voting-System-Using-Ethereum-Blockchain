      <h2><i class="fas fa-globe"></i> What Is Web3?</h2>
      <p>
        Web3 represents the next evolution of the internet, moving from:
      </p>
      
      <div class="card">
        <p><strong><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Web1 (1990s-2000s):</strong> Read-only, static websites</p>
        <p><strong><i class="fas fa-comments"></i> Web2 (2000s-present):</strong> Interactive sites where users create content, but companies control the data</p>
        <p><strong><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Web3 (emerging):</strong> Decentralized applications where users own their data and interactions happen without intermediaries</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        In technical terms, Web3 is a collection of JavaScript libraries that allow web applications to interact 
        with blockchain networks (like Ethereum) directly from the browser. It's the bridge that connects 
        regular websites to the blockchain world.
      </p>
      
      <div class="tip">
        <strong>Key Point:</strong> Web3 enables our voting application to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to 
        cast votes that are recorded directly on the blockchain without intermediaries.

    <div class="content-section">
      <h2><i class="fab fa-ethereum"></i> What Is MetaMask?</h2>
      <p>
        MetaMask is a browser extension and mobile app that serves as:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>A digital wallet for storing cryptocurrency (Ether)</li>
        <li>An identity manager for blockchain applications</li>
        <li>A gateway for accessing decentralized applications</li>
        <li>A transaction signer for approving blockchain operations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Think of MetaMask as your digital identity and wallet for the blockchain world. Just like you need 
        ID to vote in a traditional election, MetaMask provides your blockchain identity for our voting system.

      <h2><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> How Web3 and MetaMask Work in Our Voting System</h2>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> User Authentication</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of traditional username/password combinations, our voting system uses MetaMask to authenticate voters:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>When a user logs in, the application requests access to their MetaMask wallet</li>
        <li>MetaMask provides the application with the user's Ethereum address (like a unique ID)</li>
        <li>This address is checked against our database of registered voters</li>
        <li>If verified, the user can access the voting interface</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-vote-yea"></i> Vote Casting Process</h3>
      <p>
        When a voter selects a candidate and clicks "Vote":
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The Web3 library prepares a transaction to call the smart contract's voting function</li>
        <li>MetaMask displays a popup asking the user to confirm the transaction</li>
        <li>The user reviews and approves the transaction with their digital signature</li>
        <li>The transaction is sent to the Ethereum network and processed</li>
        <li>Once confirmed, the vote is permanently recorded on the blockchain</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content-section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i> Why This Approach Is Revolutionary</h2>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-lock"></i> Security</h3>
      <p>
        Only the voter can authorize transactions from their account. No one—not even the administrators of the 
        voting system—can cast a vote on someone else's behalf. This is because the private keys needed to sign 
        transactions never leave the user's MetaMask wallet.
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-fingerprint"></i> Decentralized Identity</h3>
      <p>
        MetaMask provides a decentralized identity system where users maintain control of their own credentials. 
        There's no central database of usernames and passwords that could be hacked or compromised.
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Transparency with Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        While all transactions are public on the blockchain, voters can verify their own votes without revealing 
        who they voted for to others. This balances the need for transparency with the right to privacy.
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-users"></i> Ownership of the Voting Process</h3>
      <p>
        By using Web3 and MetaMask, voters become active participants in the security of the election, 
        not just passive users of a system controlled by others.
