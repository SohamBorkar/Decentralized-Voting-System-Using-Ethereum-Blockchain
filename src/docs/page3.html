      <h2><i class="fab fa-ethereum"></i> What Is Ethereum?</h2>
      <p>
        Ethereum is like a global, decentralized computer that runs on blockchain technology. While Bitcoin 
        was designed primarily as a digital currency, Ethereum was built to do much more:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>It's a platform for creating applications that run exactly as programmed</li>
        <li>It allows developers to create "smart contracts" - self-executing code with rules built in</li>
        <li>It has its own cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH), which is used to pay for transactions</li>
        <li>It enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) that don't need central servers</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="tip">
        <strong>Key Point:</strong> Think of Ethereum as a world computer that no single entity owns or controls. 
        It runs applications based on pre-set rules that cannot be changed once deployed.
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content-section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-file-contract"></i> What Are Smart Contracts?</h2>
      <p>
        Smart contracts are self-executing programs that automatically enforce their rules and conditions. 
        In simple terms:
      </p>
      
      <div class="card">
        <p><strong><i class="fas fa-handshake"></i> Digital Agreements:</strong> Like traditional contracts but written in code</p>
        <p><strong><i class="fas fa-robot"></i> Self-Executing:</strong> They run automatically when conditions are met</p>
        <p><strong><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Tamper-Proof:</strong> Once deployed, they cannot be altered</p>
        <p><strong><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Transparent:</strong> Everyone can see the contract's code and verify its operation</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        Imagine a vending machine: you insert money, select your item, and the machine automatically 
        gives you what you selected without any human involvement. Smart contracts work similarly 
        but can handle much more complex transactions and rules.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content-section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> How Smart Contracts Power Our Voting System</h2>
      <p>
        In this voting application, we use several smart contract functions:
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> 1. Voter Registration and Verification</h3>
      <p>
        The contract maintains a list of registered voters and checks if a voter has already cast a ballot, 
        preventing double voting.
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-users"></i> 2. Candidate Management</h3>
      <p>
        Administrators can add candidates to the ballot, and the contract stores candidate information 
        and their vote counts.
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-vote-yea"></i> 3. Vote Casting</h3>
      <p>
        When a voter submits their choice, the contract verifies their eligibility, records their vote, 
        marks them as having voted, and increments the candidate's vote count - all in one atomic transaction.
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-bar"></i> 4. Vote Counting and Results</h3>
      <p>
        The contract automatically tallies votes as they come in, making results available in real-time 
        without any possibility of miscounting.
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-clock"></i> 5. Voting Period Management</h3>
      <p>
        The contract enforces voting time frames, only allowing votes to be cast during the designated period.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content-section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Why Smart Contracts Are Transformative for Voting</h2>
      <p>
        Smart contracts bring three revolutionary benefits to voting systems:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><i class="fas fa-robot"></i> <strong>No human intervention</strong> in counting or processing votes, eliminating bias and error</li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-gavel"></i> <strong>Automatic enforcement</strong> of all rules (like preventing duplicate votes)</li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-search"></i> <strong>Full transparency</strong> in how votes are processed and counted</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        This creates a system where voters don't need to trust the people running the election - 
        they can verify independently that their vote was counted correctly and that all rules were followed.
