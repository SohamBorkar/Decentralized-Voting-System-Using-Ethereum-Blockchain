      <h2><i class="fas fa-cubes"></i> Simple Explanation of Blockchain</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a ledger (like an accounting book) that records all transactions, but instead of being kept in one place:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's copied and stored on thousands of computers worldwide</li>
        <li>Each "page" (block) is linked to the previous one through complex math</li>
        <li>Once written, pages cannot be changed without changing all subsequent pages</li>
        <li>New pages can only be added when the majority of computers agree they're valid</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="tip">
        <strong>Key Point:</strong> Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized database or ledger that is shared across many computers (nodes). 
        Once a piece of data (like a vote) is recorded, it cannot be changed without altering all subsequent blocks, 
        which is practically impossible.

      <h2><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> How Blockchain Is Used in This Project</h2>
      <p>
        In our voting system, blockchain technology serves several crucial functions:
      </p>
      
      <div class="card">
        <p><strong><i class="fas fa-vote-yea"></i> Votes as Transactions:</strong> Each vote is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain</p>
        <p><strong><i class="fas fa-file-contract"></i> Smart Contracts:</strong> These are pieces of code that enforce voting rules (e.g., one person = one vote)</p>
        <p><strong><i class="fas fa-search"></i> Public Verification:</strong> Anyone can verify the results without seeing individual votes</p>
        <p><strong><i class="fas fa-lock"></i> Immutable Record:</strong> Once cast, votes cannot be changed or deleted</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        When a voter casts their vote, it's processed through a smart contract that checks if they're eligible 
        and haven't voted before. If these conditions are met, the vote is recorded on the blockchain. This creates 
        a permanent, tamper-proof record that can be publicly verified while preserving voter anonymity.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content-section">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-star"></i> Why Blockchain Is Important for Voting</h2>
      <p>
        Blockchain brings four critical benefits to voting systems:
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> 1. Transparency</h3>
      <p>
        Anyone can see the total number of votes and verify the results independently. 
        This increases trust in the process, as voters don't have to rely on a central authority 
        to correctly count and report the results.
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> 2. Security</h3>
      <p>
        It's practically impossible to alter votes once they're recorded on the blockchain. 
        This prevents tampering and ensures votes are counted exactly as they were cast.
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-network-wired"></i> 3. Decentralization</h3>
      <p>
        No single authority controls the voting system. The results are verified by a distributed network, 
        eliminating the possibility of manipulation by any single entity.
      </p>
      
      <h3><i class="fas fa-user-secret"></i> 4. Anonymity with Verification</h3>
      <p>
        Voters can verify their vote was counted correctly without revealing who they voted for. 
        This balances the need for privacy with the desire for transparency.
